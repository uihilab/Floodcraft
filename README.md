### Tasks

There are four tasks that players must complete to finish the game, each related to a different mitigation strategy:

1. **Floodwalls:** Players are required to place floodwall blocks around a river to prevent flooding from rising water. After placing the blocks, initiate flooding by pressing a button to test your setup. If there are no leaks, you will proceed to the next task.
   
2. **Sandbagging:** Place sandbag blocks around a house and follow the same process to check your setup and advance.

3. **Wet Floodproofing:** Learn about wet floodproofing by referring to in-game images, NPC guidance, and ChatGPT assistance via the chat section.
