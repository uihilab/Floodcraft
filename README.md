### Tasks
There are four tasks that the players have to complete to finish the game, each related with a different mitigation strategy. 
1) In the first task the players are required to put floodwall blocks around a river to prevent flooding in case of rising water from the river. After they finish placing the blocks they will start the flooding by pushing a button and then control their setup. If there is no leakage from the flood walls then the player will move on to the next task.
2) The second task is about sandbagging. Players will put sandbag block around the house and repeat the same process to control their setup and move on to the next task.
3) Third task will require players to learn about wet floodproofing. Players can refer to the image in the game and to the NPC to better understand the concept of wet floodproofing. Also they can always refer to chatGPT from the chat section in the game.
4) The last task is about elevation. Players should elevate the structure using structure blocks at a given time. Players' score will be updated after they finish every task.
